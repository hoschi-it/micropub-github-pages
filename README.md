A Micropub server that accepts [Micropub](http://micropub.net/) requests and creates and publishes a Jekyll/GitHub Pages post to a configured GitHub repository. This server supports posting to multiple sites from the same server. This project is inspired by [Micropub to GitHub](https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github), a Node.js implementation.
