![Tests Status Badge](https://github.com/lildude/micropub-github-pages/workflows/Tests/badge.svg) ![Linters Status Badge](https://github.com/lildude/micropub-github-pages/workflows/Linters/badge.svg) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/lildude/micropub-github-pages/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=C2W0HNSM5Q)](https://codecov.io/gh/lildude/micropub-github-pages)

A Micropub server that accepts [Micropub](http://micropub.net/) requests and creates and publishes a Jekyll/GitHub Pages post to a configured GitHub repository. This server supports posting to multiple sites from the same server. This project is inspired by [Micropub to GitHub](https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github), a Node.js implementation.

## Micropub.rocks Validation Tests

I'm using a local instance of <https://micropub.rocks> ([my fork](https://github.com/lildude/micropub.rocks) has better setup instructions than upstream - I plan to dockerise it too) to test my implimentation as I progress and this is the progress so far:
